# tictac

A Clojure library designed to implement a basic unbeatable tic-tac-toe game.

## Usage

Currently the CLI is the only piece working fully (try `lein ring server` if you are brave). You will need [leiningen 2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) or greater. To run:

```bash
$ git clone http://github.com/dudymas/tictac.git
$ cd tictac
$ lein run
```
